# employee-tracker

## Description
This employee tracker project is to build a database that takes the user input. Users are given the options to view and add department, role, and employee. When user choses to view, then a table that corresponds to what the user want to see is generated in the terminal. When user choses to add, then a series of questions are given to the user so the answers from the user can be store into the database. The database contains 3 tables that relates to the "view" options users can choose from.
